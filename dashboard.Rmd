# About

**Purpose**: The purpose of this dashboard is to summarize the difference in tuition fees between school type across all states in the United States and analyze the relationship between tuition fees and early-career salaries for their graduates.

**Source of data** This data combines two sub-datasets, salary_potential and tuition_cost, obtained from Tidyverse:<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-10>

Tuition_cost data set provides information about tuition and fees by college/unversity for 2018-2019 obtained from the Chronicle of Higher Education, and salary_potential data comes from payscale.com. Original data for tuition_cost:<https://www.chronicle.com/article/tuition-and-fees-1998-99-through-2018-19/> Original data for salary_potential:<https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-state/bachelors/new-hampshire>

# The Data

The data set provides information about tuition fees and early_career salary for different types of 4-year colleges across the United States.

## Column {.tabset}

### Out-of-State Tuition across states

Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and California have the highest out-of-state costs.

```{r}

### In-state Tuition across states

Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and California have the highest out-of-state costs.

```{r}
DT_table %>%

# Early-Career Pay

Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and California have the highest early-career pay.

```{r}

# Analysis

### Tuition vs Early-career pay

Colleges graduates from schools with higher out-of-state tuitions tend to have highest early-career pay.

```{r}

  geom_boxplot() + theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title="Relationship between out-of-state tuition and early career pay",
